## Easiest GitHub upload (no terminal auth headaches)
Use GitHub Desktop.

1. Install GitHub Desktop:
https://desktop.github.com
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.
3. File -> Add Local Repository...
4. Choose this project folder.
5. Click "Publish repository".
6. Name it however you want (example: `ci6-python-skills-studio`).
7. Click Publish.

Done. Your code is on GitHub.

## If you want terminal commands later
```bash
cd "<project-folder>"
make run
```

## Deploy online later (optional)
After GitHub works, use Render or Railway.
